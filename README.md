### Deciphering Cellular Changes During Malignant Transformation (MT) of IDH-mut Gliomas
Malignant transformation (MT) of IDH-mutant gliomas is characterized by marked cellular and molecular alterations that drive disease progression and therapy resistance. To elucidate the dynamic changes associated with MT, we comprehensively analyzed cell populations, transcriptomic profiles, and functional phenotypes in pre- and post-transformation tumor samples. Our results reveal a pronounced shift in the cellular microenvironment, including heightened infiltration of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and expansion of stem-like tumor cell subpopulations. Notably, genes involved in cell progression, were upregulated during MT, whereas differentiation and T cell activation signatures were suppressed. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the cellular plasticity that underpins malignant progression in IDH-mutant gliomas and highlight potential therapeutic targets for intervention.
